 JVM interprets the bytecode into machine code which will be executed the machine in which the java
 program runs.

        Compile the course to java class files and run the class files on a JVM. It's role in platform
 independence is serving as a binary form for java programs that is expected by the JVM but
 independent of underlying host platforms, and our program specific to a particular implementation
 of the java platform.

    JRE contains JVM class libraries and other supporting files.Java runtime environment it is used to
 run a programe in java.
 
       Java development kit is the core component of java. JDK contains tools needed to develop the
java programs. The JDK is what you need to compile java source code. These are components of the
java architecture of java...
